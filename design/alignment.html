        <h2>How Used</h2>
        <p>The principle of alignment is used for the contents to have an order, the elements to be organize, and to give visual connections. Just by looking at the contents of this website, we can notice a couple of principle of alignment was used. </p>

        <p>Look at the margin from left and right, they made sure that its contents will not hit the border of the screens. By so doing, it did give a clean and professional look for their website.</p>

        <p>When you look at the tab below, another principle of alignment was used which is the columns. If we imagine a vertical grid which would then create a column, those three tabs falls into it exactly. This allowed the user to follow through and really distinguish which is which even though the design is very similar.</p>
