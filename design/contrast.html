        <h2>How Used</h2>
        <p>Contrast is not just about having to opposite colors used in a project, but it can also be sizes,shade of colors,line weight and texture. But with this website, there's only a couple of contrasting elements were used. </p>

        <p>First, is the obvious one which is the color. To have a good contrast on their website, they have used the green color for the elements that needs more attention such as buttons and tabs. They also have used the green color for the hover and active status of a tab. This allowed the user to know where they currently are.</p>

        <p>The other contrasting element that I've noticed is the size of the fonts. You can notice this mostly on the hero area where you have the header with a bigger font size than the sentence below it.</p>
