        <h2>How Used</h2>
        <p>Typography is indeed one of the most important elemen to web design. Just like what was mention on the videos in sitepoint, "Readability and legibility are the top functions of typography". Logcially speaking, you build website for people and people read its contents. If you have bad typography, people will not visit your site. </p>

        <p>The upwork website used a very simple typeface. Since this is a website where you find people to work for you or people you can work for, it needs to be professional and they did a good job on that with the use of San Serif fonts. It's clear and very simple.</p>
