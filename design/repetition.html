        <h2>How Used</h2>
        <p>There are different ways to magnify the principle of repetition. You can use shape,color, type, space and size. With the upwork website, the main thing that was repeated throughout the design was the color. The green color on their logo was used on different occasion. One of them is the buttons. I remember a class telling me that in order for someone to click a button, it should be eye catching or it calls someone to act on it. Since this website used their brand color, it really does calls the attention of the users. </p>

        <p>Another palce that they have used the green color from their brand is the lines and the color of the fonts once you hover them or once they are active. This really differentiate the status of each tabs.</p>

        <p>Finally, the last thing that was repeated throughout their website was the illustrations. Though the illustrations are different which they normally are since they have to convey different messages, they used a similar style on their illustrations. They also used their brand colors to most of the illustrations that was used.</p>
