    <p>Plans to construct the temple were announced 7 April 1984, Church leaders broke ground 30 November 1985, and President Gordon B. Hinckley, then a member of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, dedicated the Las Vegas Nevada Temple 16 December 1989. The temple serves Latter-day Saints in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona and California.</p> <br><br><br><br><br>
    
    <h2>Las Vegas Temple Dedicated as “Oasis of Peace”</h2>
    <div class="news">
    <p>As the first dedicatory session of the Las Vegas Nevada Temple convened 16 December 1989, more than three thousand Latter-day Saints throughout the building eagerly watched the events in the celestial room via television monitors. The camera focused on a portrait of the Savior, whose arms were open, as if welcoming each to his holy house, then slowly moved to President Ezra Taft Benson, seated below the portrait.</p>

    <p>A reverent silence filled the temple as the significance of these images touched those present.</p> 
    
    <p> Benson spoke briefly, expressing his love for all.</p>

    <p>President Gordon B. Hinckley, First Counselor in the First Presidency, read the dedicatory prayer during the first dedicatory session. It was also read by different General Authorities at each of the succeeding ten sessions held over three days. The prayer, after expressing gratitude to God, the Eternal Father, for His manifold blessings, read:</p>

    <p>“We thank thee for this beautiful temple, this house of worship, of learning, of covenants and everlasting promises.” The prayer also declared that the temple stands “in this community which has become an oasis in the desert” and noted that within the temple’s walls “are to be tasted the refreshing waters of living and eternal truth. For all who enter the portals of thy house, may this be an oasis of peace and life and light, in contrast with the clamor and evil and darkness of the world.”</p>
